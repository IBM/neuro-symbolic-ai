Deep reinforcement learning has been proposed as a way to obviate the need for such heuristics, however, its deployment in automated theorem proving remains a challenge. TRAIL (Trial Reasoner for AI that Learns) is a system that applies deep reinforcement learning to saturation-based theorem proving. TRAIL leverages (a) a novel neural representation of the state of a theorem prover and (b) a novel characterization of the inference selection process in terms of an attention-based action policy.\n\n## Main Contributors\n\nIbrahim Abdelaziz, Vernon Austel, Achille Fokoue.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"b7043f74357b1fbd86a90f82ff26374e","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":150,"fieldOwners":{"source":"gatsby-plugin-mdx-source-name"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"TRAIL","description":"A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to First-Order Logic Theorem Proving","url":"https://github.com/ibm/TRAIL","tag":"KF","tags":["KF","LNN","SDM"],"weight":1},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: TRAIL\ndescription: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to First-Order Logic Theorem Proving\nurl: https://github.com/ibm/TRAIL\ntag: \"KF\"\ntags: [\"KF\", \"LNN\", \"SDM\"]\nweight: 1\n---\n\n## TRAIL: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to First-Order Logic Theorem Proving\n\nAutomated theorem provers have traditionally relied on manually tuned heuristics to guide how they perform proof search.
