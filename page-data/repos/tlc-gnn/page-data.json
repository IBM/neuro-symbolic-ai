In this work, we propose a novel topological approach based on the extended persistent homology to characterize interactions between two nodes. We propose a graph neural network method combining with this topological feature and it outperforms state-of-the-arts on different benchmarks. As another contribution, we propose a novel algorithm to more efficiently compute the extended persistence diagrams for graphs. This algorithm can be generally applied to accelerate many other topological methods for graph learning tasks.\n\n## Main Contributors\n\nZuoyu Yan, Tengfei Ma","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"3d19eafe4c660a1b36e99f31ceae16cf","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":139,"fieldOwners":{"source":"gatsby-plugin-mdx-source-name"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Persistence Homology for Link Prediction","description":"Persistence Homology for Link Prediction","url":"https://github.com/pkuyzy/tlc-gnn","tag":"Others","tags":["Others"],"weight":1},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Persistence Homology for Link Prediction\ndescription: Persistence Homology for Link Prediction\nurl: https://github.com/pkuyzy/tlc-gnn\ntag: \"Others\"\ntags: [\"Others\"]\nweight: 1\n---\n\n\n\n## Description\n\nCode for paper Link Prediction with Persistent Homology: An Interactive View (ICML2021).
