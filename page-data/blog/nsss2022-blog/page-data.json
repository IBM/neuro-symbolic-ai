The summer school had talks from over 25 IBMers in various areas of theory and the application of neuro-symbolic AI. Invited speaker and luminary in the field, **Artur d'Avila Garcez** - (City University of London), presented an overview of the broad topic in a talk entitled \"Neurosymbolic AI: The Third Wave\". \n\nThe agenda for the summer school was set to be a balance of educational content on neuro-symbolic AI, and a discussion of recent results. We are glad that the Neuro-symbolic AI community, and in particular and broad AI community, showed a great interest in the event. Over 6,000 people registered for the event and we had over 2,500 attendees. As of 24 Aug 2022, over 1,500 have accessed the recordings of the event. \n\nIn order not to miss any future events organized by us, please register at https://ibm.biz/nsss2022. You can also get a **free** digital badge for \"Neuro-Symbolic AI Essentials\" at https://www.credly.com/org/ibm/badge/neuro-symbolic-ai-essentials.\n\n---\n\n## Day 1 Session 1: Opening\n\n### Agenda\n- **Opening 20 minutes**\n   - Welcome (Alexander Gray - IBM)\n   - Motivation and Objective (Francesca Rossi - IBM)\n   - Summer School Overview (Jon Lenchner - IBM)\n   - Neuro-Symbolic AI Essentials Badge (Asim Munawar - IBM)\n- **Neurosymbolic AI: The Third Wave (Artur d'Avila Garcez - City University of London)** 1 hour\n- **Neuro-Symbolic AI Open Problems and IBM Progress (Alexander Gray - IBM)** 40 minutes\n\n---\n\n## Day 1 Session 2: Knowledge\n\n### Agenda\n- **Tutorial: Knowledge Foundations for AI Applications (Maria Chang - IBM)** 1 hour\n   - Symbolic Knowledge Representations\n   - Semantic Web\n   - AI applications using knowledge\n- **IBM Research Overview: Knowledge**\n   - Part 1: Universal Logic Knowledge Base (Rosario Uceda-Sosa - IBM) 25 minutes\n      - Interlinked KBs for broad encyclopedic, linguistic, and commonsense knowledge\n      - Supporting foundation for neuro-symbolic reasoning\n   - Part 2: ULKB Logic Language (Guilherme Lima - IBM) 25 minutes\n      - Higher order logic and simple type theory\n      - The ULKB Logic Language and its Python API\n   - Part 3: Deep linguistic processing (Alexandre Rademaker - IBM) 10 minutes\n      - Minimal recursive semantics and abstract meaning representation\n      - Open source tooling\n\n\n### Summary\n\nThe Knowledge Foundations tutorial was divided into three parts:\n1. a brief introduction to symbolic knowledge representations and why they are useful in AI\n3. Examples of existing knowledge resources, including the Semantic Web ecosystem and the distinction between ontologic knowledge sources (knowledge about the world, commonsense knowledge) and lexical knowledge sources (knowledge about language); knowledge induction and acquisition\n4. How knowledge is used in AI applications, e.g. Google knowledge graph, COVID-19 knowledge graphs\n\nThe research overview was divided into three parts:\n- In part 2, we presented the ULKB Logic Language, which is the language\n  interface to the ULKB knowledge graph.  We briefly discussed the foundations\n  and syntax of the ULKB Logic Language, and provided a quick tour through its\n  Python API using code examples to illustrate its main features.\n- In part 3, we compared two popular semantic representations for sentences: AMR and MRS. We sketched our approach to combining the MRS obtained from DELPH-IN opensource tools (ERG Grammar, ACE parser, and PyDelphin library) with AMR produced by the in-house AMR Parser to create rich semantic representation from sentences and transform it into the ULKB logic. \n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki\n- http://erg.delph-in.net/logon and http://delph-in.github.io/delphin-viz/demo/\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_recursion_semantics\n- Ontolex: https://www.w3.org/2019/09/lexicog/\n- Propbank: https://propbank.github.io/\n- Verbnet: https://verbs.colorado.edu/verbnet/\n- Semlink: https://verbs.colorado.edu/semlink/\n- Unified verb index: https://uvi.colorado.edu/\n- https://schema.org/\n- https://diff.wikimedia.org/event/%E2%99%BB%EF%B8%8F-adding-and-subtracting-wikidata-for-linguistic-analysis-in-specialized-domains%EF%BF%BC/\n- Noy, N., Gao, Y., Jain, A., Narayanan, A., Patterson, A., & Taylor, J.

In particular, we described a simple and concrete deductive system for FOL based on Resolution. Finally, we discussed important limitations of FOL and presented standard extensions to address them.\n\nIn the IBM Research Overview session, we covered a brief literature survey on various approaches for Learnable Reasoning and then introduced two of IBM's approaches, Logical Neural Networks (LNNs) and TRAIL (Trail Reasonder for AI that Learns). LNNs are a new representation for learning and reasoning which is both neural and symbolic at the same time. Core LNN concepts along with the way in which inference/reasoning and training are performed in LNNs were covered. Then TRAIL was briefly introduced, which is an RL based proof guidance system for learning reasoning strategies for various underlying reasoners. We described TRAIIL's state-of-the-art results on several known theorem proving benchmarks. Finally, a set of example application use cases where LNNs have been used was described at a high level, which included a neuro-symbolic AI question answering system and a neuro-symbolic AI reinforcement learning agent for textworld interactive games.\n\n### Reference\n- Ronald Brachman and Hector Levesque.

We developed an example logic that formalizes the properties of finite graphs. We concluded part one by presenting a two-player zero-sum game that characterizes the semantics of classical First Order Logic: two players argue about whether a formula is true or false \"inside\" a given struture. **Second,** we gave a broad introduction to computational complexity: questions about the minimum resources (such as time and memory) required to solve algorithmic problems. The most fundamental question in this area is P vs. NP: can every search problem with efficiently checkable solutions be efficiently solved? We stated and discussed the P vs. NP question, and explained that this question is _equivalent_ to questions about the expressive power of certain logics. We concluded part one by presenting a two-player zero-sum game that characterizes the expressive power of classical logics.\n\nIn the two-part **Research Overview,** we presented ongoing work about moving beyond classical logic by admitting semantic values besides \"True\" and \"False\", and a separate project that develops new game-theoretic tools for analyzing the expressive power of logics. **First,** Ron Fagin presented a new family of logics whose sentences take truth values between 0 and 1. This logic reasons about what information can be inferred about the _combinations_ of real values of a collection of formulas. Despite the richness of this logic, we presented a sound and complete axiomatization see (Fagin, Riegel, Gray, below). **Second,** Rik Sengupta gave an overview of our active research on games that characterize the expressive power of classical logics. The Multi-Sturctural game captures number of quantifiers (exists, for-all) required to define properties. The Syntactic Games generalize this to any \"reasonable\" complexity measure of logical formulas. Rik concluded our session by presenting many open problems related to logic, complexity, and games.\n\n**Keywords**: computational complexity, logical expressibility, real-valued logic, strongly complete axiomatization\n\n\n### Reference\n- **Tutorial**\n   - Textbook: Uwe Schöning, [Logic for Computer Scientists](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-8176-4763-6)\n   - Textbook: Christos H.

(Mark Wegman - IBM, Hans Florian - IBM)** 1 hour 30 minutes\n   - Computational power of transformers\n   - What limits their power and what means there are around those limits?\n   - Theoretical power of a transformer and the relation to their behavior in practice\n- **IBM Research**\n   - Inductive Logic Programming with LNN (Prithviraj Sen - IBM, Sanjeeb Dash - IBM) 20 minutes\n      - Introduction to Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)\n      - Understanding LNN Output Semantics\n      - Generating LNNs for ILP\n      - Experimental Results: Knowledge Base Completion (KBC)\n   - NS architecture zoo (Tengfei Ma - IBM, Ronny Luss - IBM) 10 minutes\n      - LNN for Times Series\n      - LNN for Mixed Models\n\n### Summary\n\nThis session is divided into different parts:\n- In the second part, we take a closer look at how to learn rules in first-order logic from labeled data using logical neural networks. While inductive logic programming has for long pursued this goal, LNNs offer the advantage of being differentiable. Thus we can use gradient-based optimization to learn rules while ensuring that said rules adhere closely to first-order logic's semantics. We demonstrate LNN's effectiveness by reporting experimental results on real-world applications.  \n\n- In the third part, we consider different architectures that make use of LNNs. We first demonstrate an  architecture that uses LNN for time series, offering interpretability beyond other time series models, and apply this to biological data regarding wound healing. Next we demonstrate how different modalities can be incorporated into LNN models using additional neural network layers. An example using MNIST images is shown.\n\n### Reference\n- Prithviraj Sen, Breno W. S. R. de Carvalho, Ryan Riegel, and Alexander Gray.

The summer school had talks from over 25 IBMers in various areas of theory and the application of neuro-symbolic AI. Invited speaker and luminary in the field, **Artur d'Avila Garcez** - (City University of London), presented an overview of the broad topic in a talk entitled \"Neurosymbolic AI: The Third Wave\". \n\nThe agenda for the summer school was set to be a balance of educational content on neuro-symbolic AI, and a discussion of recent results. We are glad that the Neuro-symbolic AI community, and in particular and broad AI community, showed a great interest in the event. Over 6,000 people registered for the event and we had over 2,500 attendees. As of 24 Aug 2022, over 1,500 have accessed the recordings of the event. \n\nIn order not to miss any future events organized by us, please register at https://ibm.biz/nsss2022. You can also get a **free** digital badge for \"Neuro-Symbolic AI Essentials\" at https://www.credly.com/org/ibm/badge/neuro-symbolic-ai-essentials.\n\n---\n\n## Day 1 Session 1: Opening\n\n### Agenda\n- **Opening 20 minutes**\n   - Welcome (Alexander Gray - IBM)\n   - Motivation and Objective (Francesca Rossi - IBM)\n   - Summer School Overview (Jon Lenchner - IBM)\n   - Neuro-Symbolic AI Essentials Badge (Asim Munawar - IBM)\n- **Neurosymbolic AI: The Third Wave (Artur d'Avila Garcez - City University of London)** 1 hour\n- **Neuro-Symbolic AI Open Problems and IBM Progress (Alexander Gray - IBM)** 40 minutes\n\n---\n\n## Day 1 Session 2: Knowledge\n\n### Agenda\n- **Tutorial: Knowledge Foundations for AI Applications (Maria Chang - IBM)** 1 hour\n   - Symbolic Knowledge Representations\n   - Semantic Web\n   - AI applications using knowledge\n- **IBM Research Overview: Knowledge**\n   - Part 1: Universal Logic Knowledge Base (Rosario Uceda-Sosa - IBM) 25 minutes\n      - Interlinked KBs for broad encyclopedic, linguistic, and commonsense knowledge\n      - Supporting foundation for neuro-symbolic reasoning\n   - Part 2: ULKB Logic Language (Guilherme Lima - IBM) 25 minutes\n      - Higher order logic and simple type theory\n      - The ULKB Logic Language and its Python API\n   - Part 3: Deep linguistic processing (Alexandre Rademaker - IBM) 10 minutes\n      - Minimal recursive semantics and abstract meaning representation\n      - Open source tooling\n\n\n### Summary\n\nThe Knowledge Foundations tutorial was divided into three parts:\n1. a brief introduction to symbolic knowledge representations and why they are useful in AI\n3. Examples of existing knowledge resources, including the Semantic Web ecosystem and the distinction between ontologic knowledge sources (knowledge about the world, commonsense knowledge) and lexical knowledge sources (knowledge about language); knowledge induction and acquisition\n4. How knowledge is used in AI applications, e.g. Google knowledge graph, COVID-19 knowledge graphs\n\nThe research overview was divided into three parts:\n- In part 2, we presented the ULKB Logic Language, which is the language\n  interface to the ULKB knowledge graph.  We briefly discussed the foundations\n  and syntax of the ULKB Logic Language, and provided a quick tour through its\n  Python API using code examples to illustrate its main features.\n- In part 3, we compared two popular semantic representations for sentences: AMR and MRS. We sketched our approach to combining the MRS obtained from DELPH-IN opensource tools (ERG Grammar, ACE parser, and PyDelphin library) with AMR produced by the in-house AMR Parser to create rich semantic representation from sentences and transform it into the ULKB logic. \n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki\n- http://erg.delph-in.net/logon and http://delph-in.github.io/delphin-viz/demo/\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_recursion_semantics\n- Ontolex: https://www.w3.org/2019/09/lexicog/\n- Propbank: https://propbank.github.io/\n- Verbnet: https://verbs.colorado.edu/verbnet/\n- Semlink: https://verbs.colorado.edu/semlink/\n- Unified verb index: https://uvi.colorado.edu/\n- https://schema.org/\n- https://diff.wikimedia.org/event/%E2%99%BB%EF%B8%8F-adding-and-subtracting-wikidata-for-linguistic-analysis-in-specialized-domains%EF%BF%BC/\n- Noy, N., Gao, Y., Jain, A., Narayanan, A., Patterson, A., & Taylor, J.

In particular, we described a simple and concrete deductive system for FOL based on Resolution. Finally, we discussed important limitations of FOL and presented standard extensions to address them.\n\nIn the IBM Research Overview session, we covered a brief literature survey on various approaches for Learnable Reasoning and then introduced two of IBM's approaches, Logical Neural Networks (LNNs) and TRAIL (Trail Reasonder for AI that Learns). LNNs are a new representation for learning and reasoning which is both neural and symbolic at the same time. Core LNN concepts along with the way in which inference/reasoning and training are performed in LNNs were covered. Then TRAIL was briefly introduced, which is an RL based proof guidance system for learning reasoning strategies for various underlying reasoners. We described TRAIIL's state-of-the-art results on several known theorem proving benchmarks. Finally, a set of example application use cases where LNNs have been used was described at a high level, which included a neuro-symbolic AI question answering system and a neuro-symbolic AI reinforcement learning agent for textworld interactive games.\n\n### Reference\n- Ronald Brachman and Hector Levesque.

We developed an example logic that formalizes the properties of finite graphs. We concluded part one by presenting a two-player zero-sum game that characterizes the semantics of classical First Order Logic: two players argue about whether a formula is true or false \"inside\" a given struture. **Second,** we gave a broad introduction to computational complexity: questions about the minimum resources (such as time and memory) required to solve algorithmic problems. The most fundamental question in this area is P vs. NP: can every search problem with efficiently checkable solutions be efficiently solved? We stated and discussed the P vs. NP question, and explained that this question is _equivalent_ to questions about the expressive power of certain logics. We concluded part one by presenting a two-player zero-sum game that characterizes the expressive power of classical logics.\n\nIn the two-part **Research Overview,** we presented ongoing work about moving beyond classical logic by admitting semantic values besides \"True\" and \"False\", and a separate project that develops new game-theoretic tools for analyzing the expressive power of logics. **First,** Ron Fagin presented a new family of logics whose sentences take truth values between 0 and 1. This logic reasons about what information can be inferred about the _combinations_ of real values of a collection of formulas. Despite the richness of this logic, we presented a sound and complete axiomatization see (Fagin, Riegel, Gray, below). **Second,** Rik Sengupta gave an overview of our active research on games that characterize the expressive power of classical logics. The Multi-Sturctural game captures number of quantifiers (exists, for-all) required to define properties. The Syntactic Games generalize this to any \"reasonable\" complexity measure of logical formulas. Rik concluded our session by presenting many open problems related to logic, complexity, and games.\n\n**Keywords**: computational complexity, logical expressibility, real-valued logic, strongly complete axiomatization\n\n\n### Reference\n- **Tutorial**\n   - Textbook: Uwe Schöning, [Logic for Computer Scientists](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-8176-4763-6)\n   - Textbook: Christos H.

(Mark Wegman - IBM, Hans Florian - IBM)** 1 hour 30 minutes\n   - Computational power of transformers\n   - What limits their power and what means there are around those limits?\n   - Theoretical power of a transformer and the relation to their behavior in practice\n- **IBM Research**\n   - Inductive Logic Programming with LNN (Prithviraj Sen - IBM, Sanjeeb Dash - IBM) 20 minutes\n      - Introduction to Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)\n      - Understanding LNN Output Semantics\n      - Generating LNNs for ILP\n      - Experimental Results: Knowledge Base Completion (KBC)\n   - NS architecture zoo (Tengfei Ma - IBM, Ronny Luss - IBM) 10 minutes\n      - LNN for Times Series\n      - LNN for Mixed Models\n\n### Summary\n\nThis session is divided into different parts:\n- In the second part, we take a closer look at how to learn rules in first-order logic from labeled data using logical neural networks. While inductive logic programming has for long pursued this goal, LNNs offer the advantage of being differentiable. Thus we can use gradient-based optimization to learn rules while ensuring that said rules adhere closely to first-order logic's semantics. We demonstrate LNN's effectiveness by reporting experimental results on real-world applications.  \n\n- In the third part, we consider different architectures that make use of LNNs. We first demonstrate an  architecture that uses LNN for time series, offering interpretability beyond other time series models, and apply this to biological data regarding wound healing. Next we demonstrate how different modalities can be incorporated into LNN models using additional neural network layers. An example using MNIST images is shown.\n\n### Reference\n- Prithviraj Sen, Breno W. S. R. de Carvalho, Ryan Riegel, and Alexander Gray.
